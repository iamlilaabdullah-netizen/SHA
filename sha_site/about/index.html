          Spartan Housing Alliance (SHA) is a student‑led advocacy organization
          at Michigan State University. Our mission is to ensure affordable and
          fair housing through policy change, community outreach, and
          educational initiatives【411978081390142†L17-L21】.

          We connect students, tenants, and local leaders to push for solutions
          together【411978081390142†L23-L25】. Through advocacy, we organize for
          concrete policy wins such as fee relief and maintenance standards【411978081390142†L27-L29】,
          and we publish research and guides to inform decision‑making【411978081390142†L30-L32】.
